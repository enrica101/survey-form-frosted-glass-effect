# survey-form-frosted-glass-effect

This is a survey form I made for a freecodecamp challenge. I modified the form background into a frosted glass effect to make it weebit cooler. Then I kind of split the page and put the form on the right side of the screen with its own customized scrollbar so the user wouldn't have to scroll the entire screen all the way down.

This project mainly composes of HTML and CSS. I could make the HTML more interactive with JavaScript but I'll do that perhaps a little later. 

Also added responsiveness on the page, making it friendly on any screen devices. 
I'm giving out a disclaimer that I made the frosted glass effect with the help of the link below. Method 2 worked really well for me and it made it really easy for me to understand.

This is my first time I succeeded on doing a frosted glass effect and I think from now on I'll be doing more of it.
